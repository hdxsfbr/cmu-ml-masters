# 📘 CMU Machine Learning Master's Curriculum – Code Repository

Welcome! This repository contains my personal implementations, exercises, and project work as I self-study the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Master’s in Machine Learning curriculum.

## 🎯 Goal

To deeply understand the core concepts and techniques of machine learning as taught at CMU by implementing them from scratch or using modern ML libraries where appropriate. This is part of a personal project focused on transitioning into a Machine Learning Engineering role.

## 📚 Curriculum Coverage

This repo is organized to mirror the structure of CMU's ML curriculum. Key topics include:

- **Foundations of Machine Learning**
- **Probabilistic Graphical Models**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Optimization**
- **Statistical Machine Learning**
- **ML Systems and Scalability**
- **Fairness, Accountability, and Interpretability**

> 📌 Note: This is an independent learning project and not affiliated with CMU.
